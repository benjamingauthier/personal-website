We are making our own products, and in parallel, we are working with other french companies, through a Business to Business process. We hired our first employee in September, 2015.

												<p>Orange is the most famous french telecom carrier. Through their Business branch I was hired to set up several off-the-shelf products to make the company more competitive on the corporate websites market for SMBs. I had to create these products from scratch. The main purpose was to reduce the costs of website creation. I used Vagrant and Puppet to automatically build a virtual machine for each website. The development duration of a website was split by two. Moreover, I had to define the marketing strategy to sell those new products.</p>
